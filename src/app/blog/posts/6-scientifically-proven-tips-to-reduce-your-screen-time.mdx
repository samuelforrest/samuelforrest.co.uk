## 1. Enable Greyscale Colour Filters

For those with Apple devices, go to:

**Settings → Accessibility → Display → Colour Filters**, then switch it to greyscale mode.  
Initially it may feel unpleasant, but it has been shown to reduce the addictive pull of social media apps.

👉 If you are technically inclined, you can create automations to toggle Colour Filters depending on the time of day or which app is open. This can be configured in the Apple Shortcuts app.

## 2. Use Opal for App Blocking

Website: [www.opal.so](https://www.opal.so)

Opal allows you to block apps based on screen time usage, time of day, or app category. The app runs in the background and adds friction when attempting to bypass limits.

👉 I use two focus modes on my iPhone: **Fun** and **Work**.

- When Fun is active, all apps are available.
- When Work mode is active, only productive apps are allowed.

Opal blocks distracting apps automatically. This can also be automated using the Apple Shortcuts app.

## 3. Eliminate All but Necessary Notifications

It is worth reviewing settings and disabling most notifications. In practice, only close friends and family require immediate alerts; everything else can wait. Your phone should be a tool you choose to use, not a constant interruption.

👉 I keep notifications enabled only for WhatsApp, Calendar and Tasks.

## 4. Redesign Your Home Screen

Hide distracting apps and remove them from the Home Screen. Replace them with productive apps and useful widgets such as calendars or task managers. This introduces friction when attempting to open distracting apps.

A minimal wallpaper can also help. A clean, simple background reduces visual clutter and prevents the device from feeling overstimulating as soon as you unlock it.

## 5. Remove Social Media Apps

This step requires weighing personal pros and cons and examining how much of a positive / negative impact social media has on your life.

Remeber you can always redownload the apps to check something, or use another device. There is no need to delete all your accounts.

👉 I chose to keep only LinkedIn and WhatsApp.

## 6. Change Specific Settings

Adjust certain system settings to reduce impulsive usage:

- Disable **Raise to Wake** or **Tap to Wake** to prevent the screen lighting up whenever the phone is picked up.
- Lower screen brightness to make the device slightly less enticing and to reduce blue light exposure before sleep.
