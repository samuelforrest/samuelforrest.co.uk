CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a relatively new approach to gene editing discovered in 1980s in bacteria. CRISPR utilises fragments of DNA left from hostile viruses in the bacteria allowing for the recognition, removal and alteration of specific genes.

It utilises an enzyme known as Cas9 which cuts segments of the DNA in tandem with a guide RNA which recognises the sequence of DNA to be modified. Essentially the guide RNA finds the harmful gene we want to remove, and the Cas9 cuts the DNA to which the gene is modified

So why is this so exciting? Well CRISPR holds several benefits other gene editing methods do not possess; it is both extremely accurate and efficient in gene modification while having the added bonus of being cheaper than other methods.

The fundamental use of CRISPR could be wide spread over various industries: in particular medicine and agriculture.

Medically the obvious benefit is that we now have a tool by which we could potentially eradicate hereditary diseases. Increasingly in recent years the application towards cancer technology has also expanded, CRISPR targeting malicious tumours with increased accuracy. CRISPR could also yield greater efficiency in drug development times further emphasising its use in the cure of several currently untreatable conditions.

Agriculturally, genetically modified crops assist in our adaptation towards climate change, producing more drought and pest resistant crops. Similarly animals can be modified to be heathier, lead a higher quality of life, and produce a better quality produce.

While CRISPR does have several ethical dilemmas, such as the modification of embryos and potential bioterrorism scares, it offers an unprecedented tool for humanity to fight some of our most pressing issues, proving one of the most fascinating biological projects of recent years
