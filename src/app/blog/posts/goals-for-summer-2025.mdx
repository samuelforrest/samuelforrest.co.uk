Summer can either be a time of crazy momentum or a time of drift. I’m choosing the first one.

I’m lucky enough to have a summer holiday of two months.

This post is therefore a public commitment — something to give me focus, clarity, and discipline over the next couple of months. I’m setting two goals in relation to my projects: one is my NEA, and the other is techy-entrepreneurial, and I want to hit them both comfortably before September.

## Goal 1: Finish my Computer Science NEA

My first goal is to fully complete the actual coding for my Computer Science NEA. I’m building an educational mobile trading simulator designed to help Gen Z.

**The Goal:** Fully functional by around 14th September.

**What I’ve Done So Far**

From September to June this year, I have been working hard on this NEA and have completed the following documentation, which amounts to around 35 pages:

- Analysis — why this is a problem, how I can solve it computationally
- Primary & Secondary Research — analysing existing solutions, their pros & cons, including a large Microsoft Forms survey sent to traders of different levels
- Stakeholders — interviewing potential stakeholders
- Software & Hardware requirements
- Success Criteria
- Structure Diagram — a high-level and simplified design
- High-level Figma design, wireframes, and mock-ups produced

Although I am yet to write a single line of code — until today.

**The Summer Plan**

In the design section of my NEA, documented during May–June, I set out my plan for developing this application. I decided to follow an Agile methodology, which includes sprints (short development cycles). This approach allows me to continuously iterate on my application and incorporate stakeholder feedback.

Each sprint will typically last one to two weeks, focusing on delivering functional components of the application, such as core features like trading logic, leaderboard systems, and the learning system. At the end of each sprint, I will review progress, conduct thorough testing, and plan the next phase.

This methodology will be effective because it allows adaptation to changes, problems, and new ideas or stakeholder feedback.

**Proposed Sprint Planning for Summer (Deadline: 12th September)**

- Trading logic, algorithm, API, database, portfolio frontend — WK 1–3
- Social features, game creation/management, live news feed — WK 4–5
- Interactive learning module creation, state management — WK 6–8
- AI integration, evaluation, last-minute changes — WK 9

I predict that the first sprint will be the toughest. The trading logic and database integration will be a true test of my development, debugging, and perseverance skills. I’m most excited for later sprints where I can build a meaningful app to help educate young people and integrate an AI LLM (such as Google Gemini 2.0) to assist users with their learning.

## Goal 2: Networking & Work Experience

As I aspire to become a software engineering degree apprentice, with competition higher than ever, networking and gaining valuable work experience will be extremely beneficial to my applications.

**Planned Activities**

- British Airways in-person work experience
- Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and other Springpod virtual work experience
- Finishing the Harvard CS50x course

In addition, I am planning to network with other students in my situation over LinkedIn, so do drop a connection if you would like to talk.
