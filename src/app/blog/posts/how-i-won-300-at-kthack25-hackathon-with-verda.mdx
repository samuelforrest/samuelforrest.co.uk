## Introducing Verda

Our winning project was a web app called **Verda** (Latin for _green_), a platform designed to empower users to make more sustainable choices in their daily lives. My teammate and I managed to win **£300 at KTHack25**.

### What does Verda do?

- Helps users sort their waste properly based on local recycling guidelines and country-specific policies.
- Calculates your lifetime carbon footprint based on your usage inputs.
- Uses AI via the Google Gemini API to deliver personalised sustainability advice.

### What was our Tech Stack?

**Frontend:** NextJS, HTML5 and Tailwind CSS.

**Backend:** Supabase SQL database to remember the results of users’ carbon footprint estimates from Gemini.

**AI:** Gemini (Gemini 2.0 Flash Developer API) accessed via JSON for speed and accuracy.
