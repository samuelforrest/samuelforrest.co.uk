## Synthetic Biology - Artifical Life

Imagine a world where we could understand every cell completely, capable of comprehending all fundamental principles of life and survival. With this deep knowledge and experience, we would be able to not only design, but create our very own artificial organisms.

## Cellular Progression

Let's magnify our focus down to a single minimal cell. Recently, scientists have began to realise this potential, synthesising and engineering a new and unique cell, titled JCVI-syn3A, consisting of only the most essential genes for life. Since its creation, biologists have remained persistent with research. JCVI-syn3A demonstrates a controlled and simple biological model, allowing researchers to meticulously study into myriads of cellular processes. However, this is only the start of this scientific journey, soon to sprout into and transform our understanding of protein synthesis, evolutionary analysis, and even showing potential in epigenetics.

## Where Can This Take Us?

By combining our newfound understanding of synthetic biology with advanced technology and artificial intelligence, we are now approaching the light at the end of the tunnel of artificial life, soon to transform our world as we know it, but will this be for the better?

## The Ethical Debate

What defines the division between 'natural' and 'artificial'? Many argue an organism should have undergone evolution to be considered natural, when others believe that we should focus more on an organisms properties than its origin. Synthetic biology also tends to raise the question; Is the human creation of life 'playing God'? Many believe synthetic life to be a form of blasphemy, reducing God's creation to mere materialistic chemical interactions. However, other counter this, conveying this intensive research purely shines light on life's complexity, rather than diminishing it.

## Conclusion

Scientists must also consider the long-term implications, such as the effects of these artificial organisms on our plant's environment and food chains, ensuring they are careful to maintain and protect life. Looking from the opposite perspective however, new organisms could be introduced with specific niches designed to stabilise an already insecure ecosystem.
