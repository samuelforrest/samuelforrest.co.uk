## What is a Degree Apprenticeship?

A degree apprenticeship is a full-time job at a company; however, you must spend at least **20% of your working hours** on training for your degree. You therefore graduate with a **BSc** in addition to a **Level 6 Degree Apprenticeship qualification**.

Many universities partner directly with employers to offer degree apprenticeships, usually following one of two main teaching models:

### Block Release

Apprentices spend a certain number of weeks per year dedicated entirely to study (at least 20%).  
For example:

- 4 weeks on block release at university
- Followed by 16 weeks working Monday to Friday at their company

### Day Release

Apprentices spend a specific day each week at university or studying online.  
For example:

- Monday to Thursday working
- Friday spent attending lectures online or in person

> During university holidays, apprentices may still be working. They are still allocated a minimum of 20% personal development time each week, which may involve project-based or tutorial-based learning.

## Drawbacks of a Degree Apprenticeship

Despite the strong benefits, there are commonly reported downsides:

### Intense Workload

Balancing a full-time job with university commitments can be demanding.

### Less Flexibility to Change Career Path

Switching fields (e.g. from investment banking to cybersecurity) is harder than at university.

### Slower Social Life

Apprentices miss out on long holidays and weekday nightlife, although weekends remain free.

### Extremely Competitive Entry Requirements

- Thousands of applicants per role
- Acceptance rates around **0.7%**
- However, unlike UCAS limits, you may apply to as many apprenticeships as you want.

### Relocation

You must move where the employer requires and manage tenancy agreements.

### Paying for Exam Resits

Many programmes require apprentices to cover resit fees themselves.

## Why Many Students Are Choosing Degree Apprenticeships

With apprentices sharing their experiences across LinkedIn, Instagram and TikTok, more students are exploring this pathway that promises a salary of **£25k+** alongside a degree.

Popular fields offering strong apprenticeship pathways include:

- **Investment Banking & Financial Services**  
  (e.g. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs)

- **Technology, Software Engineering & Cyber**  
  (e.g. Amazon, Accenture, IBM)

- **Engineering**  
  (e.g. Airbus, BAE Systems, Siemens, JLR, Rolls-Royce, British Airways)

## When University Might Still Be the Better Option

Some students prefer university because broader degrees keep multiple pathways open:

- **Computer Science** → software engineering, cybersecurity, IT, AI, machine learning, game development, fintech
- **Economics** → investment banking, financial services, consulting
- **Mechanical Engineering** → aerospace, transport, construction, finance

Ultimately, the best choice depends on alignment with long-term goals and preferred lifestyle.

## Final Thoughts

A degree apprenticeship suits individuals who want to:

- Accelerate their career
- Build financial independence early
- Gain hands-on industry experience

It rewards discipline, consistency and ambition.

University, on the other hand, offers:

- Greater freedom
- Broader exploration
- A more traditional academic and social experience

Students still discovering their interests, or planning postgraduate specialisation, may find university more suitable.
