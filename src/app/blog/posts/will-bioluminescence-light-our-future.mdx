## What is Bioluminescence?

Bioluminescence is a biochemical phenomenon by which living organisms produce visible light through enzyme-catalysed oxidation reactions. These typically involve a specific substrate called **Luciferin**, and the complementary enzyme **Luciferase**. This process occurs only in the presence of oxygen, overall generating a _cold light_ (less than 20% of energy is released as heat).

Bioluminescence can be found in a diverse variety of life forms, predominantly marine life. In the ocean, you are most likely to encounter blue or blue-green light, since this wavelength travels the farthest through water. On land, it is often yellow or green, shown by the iconic firefly.

## What is its Purpose?

Functionally, bioluminescence serves a variety of ecological roles, including:

- Camouflage via counterillumination
- Defence
- Attracting prey
- Intraspecies communication

## Can it Replace Modern Lighting?

Theoretically, there is strong possibility of bioluminescence replacing modern city lighting. Scientists have already created glowing plants using genes from bioluminescent organisms, as well as using glowing bacteria in temporary light installations. In addition, bioluminescence requires minimal energy, making it a potential alternative to modern electrically powered lighting. Overall, a reduction in CO₂ emissions could transpire, contributing to a more sustainable world.

However, it is certainly not flawless:

- Bioluminescence requires highly controlled temperatures.
- Light intensity is extremely low.
- It is drastically dim and currently unable to safely perform the function of a modern streetlight.
- A major challenge is finding a way to easily switch the light source on and off.
- Living systems containing the reaction are bound to degrade and die over time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, bioluminescence is not currently a viable option for urban lighting with existing technology. However, it is very possible that sustainable bioluminescent elements may be incorporated into urban environments in the future.
