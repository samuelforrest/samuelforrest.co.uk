## Overview

Apprentadream is an innovative platform connecting students with degree apprenticeship opportunities. As the CTO, I built a comprehensive GDPR-compliant sign-up system that has become a critical component of the platform's growth.

## The Challenge

The platform needed a robust sign-up system that could:

- Handle high volumes of registrations (150+ per week)
- Ensure full GDPR compliance for user data protection
- Provide a seamless user experience
- Integrate with existing systems

## Technical Implementation

### GDPR Compliance

Implemented comprehensive data protection measures including:

- Explicit user consent mechanisms
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Right to be forgotten functionality
- Transparent data usage policies

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Results

The sign-up system has been incredibly successful:

- Processing **150+ registrations weekly**
- 99.9% uptime
- Full GDPR compliance
- Positive user feedback
