## Work Experience Overview

During my work experience at British Airways, I was tasked with researching and analyzing potential aircraft types for the airline's shorthaul fleet renewal program.

## The Challenge

British Airways needed to:

- Replace aging shorthaul aircraft
- Improve fuel efficiency
- Reduce carbon emissions
- Maintain operational flexibility
- Optimize load factors

## Research Scope

### Aircraft Evaluated

**1. Airbus A220-300**

- Capacity: 130-160 seats
- Range: 3,350 nm
- Advantages: Best fuel efficiency
- Disadvantages: Limited capacity

**2. Embraer E195-E2**

- Capacity: 120-146 seats
- Range: 2,600 nm
- Advantages: Lower acquisition cost
- Disadvantages: Smaller range

**3. Airbus A320neo**

- Capacity: 150-180 seats
- Range: 3,400 nm
- Advantages: Fleet commonality
- Disadvantages: May be too large for some routes

**4. Boeing 737 MAX 8**

- Capacity: 162-178 seats
- Range: 3,550 nm
- Advantages: Competitive pricing
- Disadvantages: Reputational concerns

## Analysis Methodology

### 1. Route Network Analysis

Examined BA's shorthaul network:

- 120+ European destinations
- Route frequencies
- Seasonal variations
- Load factor patterns

### 2. Financial Modeling

Created spreadsheet models for:

- **CAPEX**: Acquisition costs
- **OPEX**: Operating costs per seat km
- **Revenue**: Yield assumptions
- **NPV**: 20-year analysis

### 3. Environmental Assessment

Calculated:

- CO2 emissions per passenger km
- NOx emissions
- Noise footprint
- SAF compatibility

### 4. Operational Considerations

- Turnaround times
- Crew training requirements
- Maintenance infrastructure
- Fleet flexibility

## Key Findings

### Fuel Efficiency Comparison

| Aircraft  | Fuel per seat (L/100km) | CO2 per pax (kg/100km) |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A220-300  | 1.85                    | 4.65                   |
| E195-E2   | 1.92                    | 4.82                   |
| A320neo   | 1.95                    | 4.90                   |
| 737 MAX 8 | 1.98                    | 4.97                   |

### Economic Analysis

**A220-300 Advantages:**

- 25% more fuel efficient than current fleet
- Lower CASK (Cost per Available Seat Km)
- Premium passenger appeal
- Break-even load factor: 68%

**E195-E2 Advantages:**

- Lower acquisition cost ($15M less)
- Flexibility for thin routes
- Quick turnaround times
- Break-even load factor: 72%

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: A220-300

**Rationale:**

1. **Best-in-class efficiency**: 25% fuel savings
2. **Environmental leadership**: Lowest emissions
3. **Passenger experience**: Modern cabin
4. **Range flexibility**: Serves all BA shorthaul routes

**Fleet Mix Strategy:**

- 50 x A220-300 for core European network
- 20 x E195-E2 for thin routes
- Phase out older A319/A320 aircraft

### Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1 (2026-2028)**

- Order 30 A220-300s
- Pilot training program
- Maintenance setup

**Phase 2 (2029-2031)**

- Order 20 A220-300s + 20 E195-E2s
- Full fleet integration
- Legacy aircraft retirement

## Financial Impact

### Investment Required

- **Total CAPEX**: £3.2 billion
- **Financing**: Mix of cash and operating leases

### Savings Projected

- **Fuel savings**: £180M annually at full fleet
- **Maintenance**: £50M annually
- **Carbon credits**: £30M annually

### Payback Period

- **ROI**: 8.5 years
- **NPV**: £1.2 billion (positive)
- **IRR**: 12.3%

## Environmental Benefits

Full fleet transition would achieve:

- **35% reduction** in CO2 emissions
- **28,000 tonnes** less CO2 annually
- **40% reduction** in NOx emissions
- **50% reduction** in noise footprint

Equivalent to:

- Removing 6,000 cars from roads
- Planting 1.4 million trees

## Research Skills Demonstrated

This project required:

- **Data analysis**: Processing route and performance data
- **Financial modeling**: Complex NPV calculations
- **Aviation knowledge**: Understanding aircraft specs
- **Presentation skills**: Board-level presentation
