## Research Overview

For my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), I conducted extensive research into the future of supersonic aviation, focusing on whether commercial supersonic flight can make a sustainable comeback.

## Research Questions

The dissertation explored three key areas:

### 1. Economic Viability

- Market demand analysis
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Ticket pricing models
- Profitability projections

### 2. Environmental Impact

- Fuel efficiency comparisons
- Carbon emissions analysis
- Sonic boom mitigation
- Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) potential

### 3. Technological Challenges

- Engine technology advances
- Aerodynamic innovations
- Materials science developments
- Regulatory hurdles

## Key Findings

### Boom Supersonic

Analyzed Boom Supersonic's Overture aircraft:

- Mach 1.7 capability
- 65-80 passenger capacity
- Net-zero carbon commitment
- 2029 target date

### Economic Analysis

- Premium market potential: $8-10 billion annually
- Break-even analysis shows profitability possible
- Ticket prices estimated at $4,000-$6,000 for transatlantic routes

### Environmental Considerations

- Modern designs 75% more fuel efficient than Concorde
- SAF compatibility crucial for sustainability
- Sonic boom reduction through design innovation

## Research Methodology

- Literature review of 50+ academic sources
- Industry expert interviews
- Economic modeling
- Environmental impact assessment

## Conclusions

The research concluded that:

1. Supersonic flight is economically viable for premium routes
2. Environmental challenges require innovative solutions
3. Regulatory framework needs modernization
4. Market exists for time-sensitive travelers

## Academic Recognition

- Grade: A\*
- Commended for thoroughness and analysis
- Presented findings to school board

This project demonstrates my research capabilities, analytical thinking, and ability to synthesize complex technical information into coherent arguments.
