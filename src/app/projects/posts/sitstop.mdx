## Overview

A client, who is part of a local charity called SIT STOP, contacted me requesting for an update for their
outdated website. The new website needed to be accessible for users of all ages, needed to be mobile-friendly
and display the locations of all the seats.

SIT STOP is a local charity that displays their logo on a sticker within local businesses, which means that
the business has agreed to provide free seating to anyone who needs it, including the elderly, children, those
with illnesses or those who are tired and struggling to walk.
